# Scanner App

This is an app made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs)

## Setting up

First, make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.

Then, setup the recommended workspace VSCode extensions, by going to

```
Extensions > Type @recommended > Click on the cloud icon to download the recommended extensions
```

## Installing and adding dependencies

Run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies. To add dependencies, use `pnpm add`. More commands and troubleshooting can be found in the pnpm docs.

## Running the application

Run `pnpm dev`

## Setting up Supabase locally

Supabase can be setup locally for an easier dev experience, a guide can be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development)

> [!NOTE]
> You can run supabase commands directly by invoking `pnpm supabase <your_command>`, instead of running `pnpx` or `npx`
